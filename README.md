# About

this repository contains some code to generate docker images which could be
used in the official geOrchestra docker composition and/or the helm chart

## Exim

The source code was formerly hosted on the [Camptocamp github
organzation](https://github.com/camptocamp/docker-exim).

The main purpose of the generated docker image is to provide a SMTP server
which can be configured with environment variables to route outgoing e-mails
to a smarthost.
